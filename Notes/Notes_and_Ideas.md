# Notes cum Ideas

This markdown file will contain some general notes and ideas that will come across during the lifetime of this competition.

## Ideas

- As the original dataset is very large, it will almost be impossible to do experiments quickly on it. Create a sample dataset and do experiments on it. Once the experiments are done, then do the experiments on the original dataset. This will also let us do these experimentations on a local machine. (DONE)
- Read some notebooks published by other participants. This will give us some ideas about how to approach this problem.

## Tasks

A comprehensive task list will be available at Notion shortly. For now, here is a brief list of tasks that I have in mind:

- [x] Get familiar with the data.
- [ ] Get familiar with the evaluation metric.
- [x] Create a sample dataset and try to train a model on it. (Since the dataset is huge, it will take a lot of time to train a model on it. So, it is better to create a sample dataset and train a model on it.)
- [ ] Create a baseline model.
